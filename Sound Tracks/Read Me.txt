Hey there! 

Thanks for downloading my free RPG Adventure game music pack! This pack contains 5 tracks (as WAVS), covering a wide range of moods for use in your next project.

I hope these tracks serve your project well! No need to credit me or purchase a license to use these in your commercial game, however if you do use this music, I would love to see/hear it in action with your project!

If you liked what you heard in this pack and would like custom music or just a customised version of the music already provided in this pack then please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch at:

Good luck and all the best,
Joey Besch
